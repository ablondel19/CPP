//////////////////////////////////////////////

there are many ways like these , but there exist one way , 
if your input numbers are between -10^9 to 10^9 , 
you can read your array , and make new array and when 
you read a number in array plus its place in other Array Like A

if your first array named B :

for (i from zero to size of Array)

A[B[i]]++

when you do this , you used O(n) time complexity , 
then have a survey on new array and it will Take O(n) time .
so your time complexity will be O(n)
